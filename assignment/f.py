# Explanation of the program:

# The program is a loop that runs 5 times (n = 1 to 5)
for n = 1:5
    # In each iteration:
    # 1. It calculates x as n * 0.1
    x = n*0.1;
    # 2. It calls a function myfunc2 with arguments x, 2, 3, and 7
    z = myfunc2(x,2,3,7);
    # 3. It prints the values of x and z in a formatted string
    fprintf('x = %4.2f f(x) = %8.4f \r',x,z)
# The loop ends

# Notes:
# - The function myfunc2 is not defined in the given code snippet
# - The output will show 5 lines, each with different values of x and z
# - x will take values 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5
# - z will depend on how myfunc2 is defined
