To solve this problem using Newton's method, we'll follow these steps:

Identify the equation: f(x) = x³ - 0.165x² + 3.993 × 10⁻⁴
Find the derivative: f'(x) = 3x² - 0.33x
Choose an initial guess (x₀)
Apply Newton's method formula: xₙ₊₁ = xₙ - f(xₙ) / f'(xₙ)
Repeat for 3 iterations

Let's begin:

Initial guess: Let's use x₀ = 0.05 (half the ball's radius as a reasonable starting point)
First iteration:
f(0.05) = 0.05³ - 0.165(0.05²) + 3.993 × 10⁻⁴ = 0.0003993125
f'(0.05) = 3(0.05²) - 0.33(0.05) = 0.00585
x₁ = 0.05 - (0.0003993125 / 0.00585) = 0.0317672
Second iteration:
f(0.0317672) = 0.0000321883
f'(0.0317672) = 0.0023674
x₂ = 0.0317672 - (0.0000321883 / 0.0023674) = 0.0281852
Third iteration:
f(0.0281852) = 0.0000002655
f'(0.0281852) = 0.0018627
x₃ = 0.0281852 - (0.0000002655 / 0.0018627) = 0.0281709

The depth after three iterations is approximately 0.0281709 meters or 2.82 cm.
To calculate the absolute relative approximate error:
Error = |(xₙ - xₙ₋₁) / xₙ| × 100%
After 1st iteration: |(0.0317672 - 0.05) / 0.0317672| × 100% = 57.39%
After 2nd iteration: |(0.0281852 - 0.0317672) / 0.0281852| × 100% = 12.71%
After 3rd iteration: |(0.0281709 - 0.0281852) / 0.0281709| × 100% = 0.05%
The error decreases significantly with each iteration, showing convergence to the solution.
